## Antilaconia - across the bay from the laconic StatusNet

Antilaconia is a very minimal microblogging engine, which is intended
to be kinda similar to StatusNet, except:

1. it doesn't support any of the fancy features,
2. it's more geared for personal websites and not big public sites, and
3. it uses Ruby platform.

The idea is that you can just install Ruby on a webhost, pull in a few gems,
and stick this in as a CGI script.

**Note that the thing just doesn't work at the moment.** It creates the
"data model", if it can be called that at the moment, and that's it.
It's mostly copypaste from tutorial at the time. Needless to say,
DON'T USE THIS. =)

### Licence

This software is distributed under [GNU AGPL 3.0 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html).

### Requirements

Aside of Ruby 1.9.x, you need at least this:

    # gem install camping bcrypt-ruby

I'm developing this on SQLite storage engine. Can't vounch for
anything else at all, but since this is built on top of Active Record,
other databases ought to work too.

### Installation

Edit the config.ru file for pertinent, mostly self-explanatory settings.

For some reason, camping console doesn't want to read `config.ru`'s database
settings. You may want to set up a link to your database manually.

    $ ln -s /wherever/lies/your/database.sqlite ~/.camping.db

Set up the user account.

    $ camping -C config.ru
    ...
    irb> u = Antilaconia::Models::User.new
    irb> u.username = 'whoeveryouare'
    irb> u.password = 'wHaTeV3rYouRpAssW0rD1s'
    irb> u.save
    irb> exit

You may now remove your link.

    $ rm ~/.camping.db
