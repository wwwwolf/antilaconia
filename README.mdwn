## Antilaconia - across the bay from the laconic StatusNet

Antilaconia is a very minimal microblogging engine, which is intended
to be kinda similar to StatusNet, except:

1. it doesn't support any of the fancy features,
2. it's more geared for personal websites and not big public sites, and
3. it uses Ruby platform.

The idea is that you can just install Ruby on a webhost, pull in a few gems,
and stick this in as a CGI script.

**Note that the thing just doesn't work at the moment.** It creates the
"data model", if it can be called that at the moment, and that's it.
It's mostly copypaste from tutorial at the time. Needless to say,
DON'T USE THIS. =)
